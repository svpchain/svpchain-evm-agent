// Command operator-keygen mints this agent's operator key: it writes a fresh
// eth_secp256k1 key to -out and prints the svp1… address that key derives.
//
// It exists because deriving that address is not something a deploy script can
// do. The key itself is 32 random bytes — `openssl rand -hex 32` would produce
// a perfectly good one — but the address is keccak over the public key, then
// bech32 with the chain's prefix, and the bond has to be funded to that address
// before agent_self_register will succeed. So the same Go that the agent parses
// its key with mints it, and answers the only question that follows.
//
// scripts/deploy.sh --gen-operator-key is the intended caller; running it by
// hand is fine and takes the same one flag.
//
// The key is written, never printed. A secret on stdout ends up in a scrollback
// buffer, a CI log, or a `tee`; the file is created with O_EXCL at 0600 so the
// tool cannot overwrite an existing identity, and a key that is already an
// agent's on-chain id — with a bond posted against it — must never be silently
// replaced.
