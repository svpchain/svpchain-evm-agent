// This is the one place the agent stops being keyless. Everything else the
// agent builds is signed by the *caller*; only MsgAgentExecDelegated — where
// the chain requires the registered operator as the tx signer — and the
// operator's own registry lifecycle sign in-process.

// succeed, and it cannot be recovered from the key by looking at it: the
// derivation is keccak, then bech32 with the chain's prefix. Minting a key
// without being told its address leaves the operator with a secret and no way
// to fund it short of booting the agent and asking agent_identity.
//
// Every call yields a different key, and a key IS an identity here: the agent
// id derives from it and agent_self_register bonds funds against it. Replacing
// a key an agent already registered under strands that registration and its
// bond — so callers that persist the result must refuse to overwrite, rather
// than treating this as a regenerable artifact.
