// Package operator holds the agent's own signing identity: the eth_secp256k1
// operator key delegated executions (and the agent's self-registration) are
// signed with, and the fee-aware direct-sign path those transactions need.
//
// This is the one place the agent stops being keyless. Everything else the
// agent builds is signed by the *caller*; only MsgAgentExecDelegated — where
// the chain requires the registered operator as the tx signer — and the
// operator's own registry lifecycle sign in-process.
