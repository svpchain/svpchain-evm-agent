// Package owner holds the key that registers this agent on chain: the account
// that pays the registration fee and the bond, and controls the record
// thereafter.
//
// This key is NOT the agent's. Since the switch to caller-signed MCP the agent
// signs nothing — every transaction it builds is signed by the caller — so the
// deployed binary never loads a key and the deploy ships none to the remote.
// This one lives on the operator's own machine, in the agent's config
// directory, and is read by cmd/agent-register alone.
//
// # One key, both chain roles
//
// x/agent separates two accounts. The OWNER signs the lifecycle messages
// (register, update, deposit/withdraw bond, deregister) and is where a
// withdrawn bond returns. The OPERATOR is the address the DID embeds —
// did:svp:<bech32> — and whose public key verifies SVP-DT credentials the
// agent issues.
//
// A caller-signed agent issues no credentials and holds no signing key, so
// there is no second identity to mint. This key is registered as both, and the
// agent id derives from it. MsgRegisterAgent accepts that: it requires the
// public key to be the operator's own (PublicKeyMatchesOperator) and the id to
// derive from the operator address (AgentIdFromOperator), and both hold when
// the two roles are one account.
//
// # One key registers exactly one agent
//
// This is the cost of collapsing the roles, and it is not recoverable after
// the fact. x/agent binds an operator address to at most one agent — see
// keeper/registry.go, "operator %q is already bound to agent %q" — and the
// registered public key is explicitly not updatable. So a second agent needs a
// second owner key, and a fleet keeps one per agent. The deploy already gives
// each agent its own config directory, which is where that separation lands.
