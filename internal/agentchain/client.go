// Package agentchain is the client side of this agent's x/agent registry
// lifecycle: query what the chain currently holds for an agent, and land a
// signed registration or update.
//
// It is a LOCAL client, run by the operator from their own machine, not
// something the deployed agent does. That is a change from the flow this
// replaces. Registration used to be self-registration — the agent held an
// operator key on the remote and signed its own MsgRegisterAgent, so the tool
// was an A2A client that authenticated to the running agent and asked it to
// register itself. A caller-signed agent has no key to do that with, so the
// transaction is built and signed here, against the owner key, and the agent's
// only part is serving the card that gets hashed into it.
//
// What still cannot move is the card hash. The value published on chain is the
// sha256 of the card as SERVED, so registering requires a running agent
// answering at its public URL — see cmd/agent-register, which fetches it.
